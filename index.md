## Summary
I am looking for a full-time software development job starting in June 2024. I was a graduate research assistant at **Georgia Tech** for 4 years, and my research projects are about leveraging software testing and program analysis to improve the performance of
database systems. I am excited about transitioning to a career in industry.
## Education
* I quit the PhD program at **Georgia Tech** and expect to graduate with a Master's in Computer Science in Spring 2024 .

* I received a Bachelor of Computer Science from **University of Michigan** in 2019.


## Fundings
* __School of Computer Science Incubator Graduate Fellowship (2022)__\
Delivered a proposal on inferring properties of user-defined functions in order to improve the performance of database systems.\
Awarded $25k funding from Georgia Tech.
* __Alibaba Innovative Research Funding (2021)__\
Delivered a proposal on inferring properties of user-defined functions in order to improve the performance of large scale data processing platforms at Alibaba.\
Awarded $50k funding from Alibaba.



## Experience
* I was a PhD student co-advised by Dr. Alessandro Orso and Dr. Joy Arulraj at **Georgia Tech**. My research projects received 2 research fundings and led to 2 publications at a top-tier conference.

* I TA'ed CS-6300 Software Development Process class at **Georgia Tech** for 3 semesters.

* I was a Research Intern at the Microsoft Gray Systems Lab, fortunately mentored by [Dr. Venkatesh Emani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kvemani/). I developed a technique and tool, named Polysem, that enables queries from different modalities to execute on PowerBI. 

* I was an undergraduate research assistant at **University of Michigan**, where I was fortunately mentored by [Dr. Westley Weimer](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/).
