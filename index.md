## Research Interests
Software Engineering, Database Systems.

## Education
* I quit the PhD program at **Georgia Tech** and expect to graduate with a master degree in Spring 2024 .

* I received a Bachelor in Computer Science from **University of Michigan**.


## Fundings
**School of Computer Science Incubator Graduate Fellowship (2022)**\
Delivered a proposal on inferring properties of user-defined functions in order to improve the performance of database systems.\
Resulted in $50k funding from Georgia Tech.\
**Alibaba Innovative Research Funding (2021)**\
Delivered a proposal on inferring properties of user-defined functions in order to improve the performance of data processing platforms at Alibaba.\
Resulted in $50k funding from Alibaba.



## Experience
* I was a PhD student co-advised by Professor. Alessandro Orso and Professor. Joy Arulraj at **Georgia Tech**. My research projects led to 2 publications at a top-tier conference and received 2 research fundings.

* I TA'ed CS-6300 Software Development Process class at **Georgia Tech** for 3 semesters.

* I was a Research Intern at the Microsoft Gray Systems Lab, fortunately mentored by [Dr. Venkatesh Emani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kvemani/). I developed a technique and tool, named Polysem, that enables queries from different modalities to execute on PowerBI. 

* I was an undergraduate research assistant at **University of Michigan**, where I was fortunately mentored by [Professor. Westley Weimer](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/).
